# IR-remote-controlled-robot
In this project, I have developed a moving IR remote controlled robot on Arduino-Uno using 3D online modeling program Tinkercad.

# Instructions Followed
This project is for IR Remote Controlled robot using Arduino Uno, in which IR remote control the movement of the robot by controlling its left and right wheels (DC motor) as
per following logic.
When “UP” key is pressed make the robot to move in forward direction with left and right wheel on same rpm (positive)
When “DOWN” key is pressed make the robot to move in reverse direction with left and right wheel on same rpm (negative)
When “LEFT” key is pressed, stop the left wheel( 0 rpm) and maximum positive rpm on right wheel to move towards left direction
When “RIGHT” key is pressed, stop the right wheel( 0 rpm) and maximum positive rpm on left wheel to move towards right direction

# Result
Simulated and verified this logic on Arduino Uno using Tinkercad circuits simulator.
